# Instructions on setting up Pixafari's databse server

## Initialize MySQL database
1. Make sure you have installed MySQL on your computer
If you have never installed it, you can download the MySQL community server here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
Also, MySQL Workbench is a very convenient tool for developers: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

2. Make sure MySQL server is running. 
To ensure the backend running successfully, you need to check if the MySQL server is always on.
